# Split up the JVM options passed in via JAVA_OPTS and GRADLE_OPTS
# We need to do this to separate "key" and "value" args
# This is needed to support the way the jvmargs are passed to the running jvm
# This is because the launcher code uses 'java_opts->add_java_option' which requires a C string
# for the key and a C string for the value and we don't want to require users to pass in
# the '=' in the arg.
#
# This is a bug in the launcher code that needs to be fixed.
#
# When this is fixed, we can just pass the JAVA_OPTS and GRADLE_OPTS vars
# and not have to split them up.
#
# This will not be done now because it is a breaking change for an edge case.
#
# See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/17325
#
# This is a workaround for the bug.
#
# This is a copy of the code in the launcher that does the splitting.
#
# This is a bit of a hack, but it is the best we can do for now.

# This will be removed when the launcher is fixed.
